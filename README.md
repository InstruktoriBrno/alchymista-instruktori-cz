Potential upgrades
------------------
* Do not display all team member profiles at once, only show portraits and display profile only when portrait is selected.
* Use a lightbox gallery (e.g. `react-images`) to display larger version of images.
* There is a few links to images in the FAQ section. Display them in a gallery.
* There is a links to a costume sewing instructions. Either display them in a new window or copy them to the webpage.

Bugs
----
* For some reason, favicons cannot be found on the server even though they are present in the directory. Works while using `gatsby serve`.
* When scrolled to the bottom of the site, the `#team` anchor is active instead of `#contact`.
